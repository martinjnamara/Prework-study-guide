#README for PREWORK STUDY GUIDE

## Description

This is A WEB Site for study notes to support the FRONT-END WEB DEVELOPMENT course

#Motivations and rationale for the web site#

- To have ready access to the course notes for the pre-work course section, an accessible way to retrieve the notes from the Front-end web development 
  course was required

- This website was built to enhance skills and experience in cutting-edge front-end web technology but also to provide access to the valuable notes 
  generated during the project for future reference

- This website allows location independent access to the course notes

- This project gave me a new appreciation of a number of front-end web technologies

- The project provides an approach which is both environmentally sound and provides ready visual access to the course notes which can be expanded on as
  the course develops and beyond

#Challenges

This was a challenging project in that much of the technology, HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript were essentially new to me. It would be possible to spend 
weeks or month studying this area in detail, however, by following the lectures and course notes and following up on reference sources provided, this 
site has been built and deployed  using the essentials of HTML, Git, CSS and JavaScript â€“ and all in a little more than a week!

#Future options
It may be possible to augment and enhance this site as the course goes forward. In particular, we could provide a single or multiple pages for each 
topic and automate it such that the existing topic selection links directly to the relevant pages

#Web site link
This information and link wll be provided at a later time

#Installation
The website will be deployed using Git Pages

#Usage
This website can provide a reference point for all future work -especially if maintained and augmented.
Essentially, it provide notes to support the technologies introduced during the prework section of the course.
The website is broken down into a number of topics. These are HTML, Git, CSS and JavaScript. The action of JavaScript can be inspected by using the 
Chrome DevTools console capability of the Chrome Browser.
When active this website will automatically and randomly select one of the available topics for studying.

#Credits
This work could not have been done without the skill, (and patience), of the tutors, the TAs and other staff running this Bootcamp.
Enormous credit must also go to the entire software developement community who generously support their peers and newbie's with an extensive repository 
of educational and support information in a way unparallelled in human history.
